# Object Oriented Programming
In this repo, you will find two projects demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design in C++.

## LMS
This project involves the design of a Learning Management System (LMS). The main goal of this system is to create university courses and manage their delivery. It also includes several **social-media-like tools**.

Three types of users are considered, each with a variety of commands.
* Admin
  * `POST course_offer`
* Professor
  * `POST course_post`
  * `GET course_post`
  * `POST ta_form`
  * `POST close_ta_form`
  * `GET course_channel`
* Student
  * `PUT my_courses`
  * `DELETE my_courses`
  * `GET my_courses`
  * `POST course_post`
  * `GET course_post`
  * `POST ta_request`
  * `GET course_channel`
* All Users
  * `POST login`
  * `POST logout`
  * `GET courses`
  * `POST post`
  * `DELETE post`
  * `GET personal_page`
  * `GET post`
  * `POST connect`
  * `GET notification`
  * `POST profile_photo`

## Car wash
In this project, a system for managing a car wash is designed, focusing on tracking the status of employees, cars, and different sections of the car wash. Cars go through several stages of washing as they move through the car wash. Each car proceeds through these stages in sequence, and if there is no available worker for a specific stage, the car waits in line until a worker becomes available. Finally, after completing the last stage, the car exits the car wash.
